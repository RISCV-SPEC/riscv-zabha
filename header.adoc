[WARNING]

====
Change is extremely unlikely. A high threshold will be used, and a change will
only occur because of some truly critical issue being identified during the
public review cycle. Any other desired or needed changes can be the subject of a
follow-on new extension. This draft specification will change before being
accepted as standard, so implementations made to this draft specification will
likely not conform to the future standard.

== Introduction

The A-extension offers atomic memory operation (AMO) instructions for _words_,
_doublewords_, and _quadwords_ (only for `amocas`). The absence of atomic
operations for subword data types necessitates emulation strategies. For bitwise
operations, this emulation can be performed via word-sized bitwise AMO*
instructions. For non-bitwise operations, emulation is achievable using
word-sized `LR`/`SC` instructions.

Several limitations arise from this emulation approach:

. In systems with large-scale or Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)
  configurations, emulation based on `LR`/`SC` introduces issues related to
  scalability and fairness, particularly under conditions of high contention.

. Emulation of narrower AMOs through wider AMO* instructions on non-idempotent
  IO memory regions may result in unintended side effects.

. Utilizing wider AMO* instructions for emulating narrower AMOs risks activating
  extraneous breakpoints or watchpoints.

. In the absence of native support for subword atomics, compilers often resort
  to inlining code sequences to provide the required emulation. This practice
  contributes to an increase in code size, with consequent impacts on system
  performance and memory utilization.

The Zabha extension aims to address these limitations by adding support for _byte_
and _halfword_ atomic memory operations to the RISC-V Unprivileged ISA
cite:[unpriv]. The Zabha extension depends upon the Zaamo standard extension.
