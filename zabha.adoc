== Byte and Halfward Atomic Memory Operations

The Zabha extension supplements the A and Zacas extensions by introducing
support for byte and halfword atomic memory operations. It designates byte (0)
and halfword (1) as valid encodings for the width field in atomic memory
operation instructions.

[NOTE]
====
The Zabha extension specifically does not extend the `LR` and `SC` instructions
to support byte and halfword encodings, as the marginal utility of such an
inclusion is deemed limited.
====

For halfword AMOs, the `rs1` address must be aligned to a two-byte boundary.
Failure to adhere to this alignment will trigger exceptions, in accordance with
the exception-handling mechanisms defined by both the A and Zam extensions.
